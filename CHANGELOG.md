## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-XX

Initial public release.

### Added

- `piloop init`: makes a git repo a project, measures the baseline and registers it. Two bundled examples:
  `enwik8` (compress Wikipedia text) and `titanic-tracks` (accuracy and CPU cost on Kaggle's Titanic data).
- The daemon, `piloop serve`: starts coding agents (Claude Code, Codex or pi) in git worktrees, scores every commit
  with the project's evaluate command, and keeps what beats the head.
- The verdict: one primary metric that must improve with confidence, guardrail metrics with margins and floors, and
  a paired bootstrap over per-unit results.
- Three agent roles: the worker, the watchdog and the research agent, with a scout mode for outside techniques.
- Ideas, seeds, links between ideas, branch runs from pinned starting points, notes on regressed results, and
  imported reference candidates.
- Tracks: several objectives for one project, on one trunk.
- The orchestrator skills (setup, operate, review) for Claude Code, Codex, pi, Gemini CLI and Cursor, and the inbox
  where the orchestrator records its decisions.
- `piloop watch`: the campaign on one screen, with keys to act on it.
- Stop conditions, token accounting for every agent, and a hard spend limit in USD.
- Session capture of every agent with Entire.
- MCP servers for the agents of a role, defined once for every harness, with keys from the daemon's environment or
  `PILOOP_SECRETS_COMMAND`.
- `piloop restart`, `piloop upgrade`, `piloop doctor` and `piloop service-unit` for campaigns that run for days.
