{header(SOURCE)}
`piloop.toml` is at the root of the campaign repo. `piloop init` reads it again each time you run it, and stores a
copy. The daemon uses that copy, so an edit takes effect only when you run `piloop init`.

To override a key when `piloop init` reads the file, set `PILOOP_CAMPAIGN_<KEY>`. Join nested keys with `__`, for
example `PILOOP_CAMPAIGN_PLUGINS__RUNTIME__USE=subprocess` or `PILOOP_CAMPAIGN_PLUGINS__ROLE__IMPLEMENTER__MAX_CONCURRENT=2`. The stored copy keeps the
override until the next `piloop init`. The variable has no effect on `piloop serve`.

A type in the tables links to the section that describes it. A table that you leave out has the defaults of its
section.
