{header('the tables of core and of each plugin (`piloop.db.schema`)')}
Every client reads and writes one SQLite database, `$PILOOP_HOME/piloop.db`. Run one statement with `piloop sql`.
`piloop schema` prints the same tables with the guides that agents follow, and `piloop schema <guide>` prints one
guide.

The indexes are part of the contract: they show which filters are cheap. The [data model](/reference/data-model)
shows the same tables as a diagram. Each section is core's tables, or a plugin's that adds them
([tables and migrations](/plugins/contributions#tables-and-migrations)).
