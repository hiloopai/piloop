"""Fault injection on leases: a worker killed or frozen during a run and during an evaluation, a late report, a
duplicate report, a partition past the toleration, and a daemon killed and started again.

A worker in a process of its own (``tests/fixtures/worker_process.py``) takes the jobs of a control plane in the test
process, so that ``kill -9`` and ``SIGSTOP`` hit the worker and not the control plane. The leases use short times
(``FAST``), the same two stages as the defaults.
