"""An implementer that works past its time is told to wrap up in its turn, and finishes before its timeout.

    uv run pytest -m e2e tests/e2e/test_deadline.py -rA [--e2e-harness claude] [--e2e-model <model>]

The role timeout is 5 minutes, so the wrap-up comes 75 seconds before it. The idea asks for more one-minute steps
than fit, all in one turn. Claude Code refuses a long ``sleep``, so a step sleeps in Python. A Claude agent reads the
wrap-up after its next tool call, commits and leaves its finding, and the daemon ends it a minute later. About 6
minutes and 0.1 USD.
