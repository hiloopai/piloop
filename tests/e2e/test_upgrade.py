"""An upgrade from the last release to this checkout loses nothing, with a run in flight, on a home with real work.

    uv run pytest -m e2e tests/e2e/test_upgrade.py -rA [--e2e-model <model>]

piloop ``RELEASE`` from PyPI runs a small enwik8 campaign: a keep, a discard, a cancelled run, notes, an archive of the
keep's workspace files and a ``research/`` loss table. Its ``piloop.toml`` has forms that the release bridged with a
warning and this checkout removed: ``[roles.*]`` with an inline list of triggers that names ``anomaly``, ``[memory]
documents`` and ``[spend]``. While two agents of the release work, the user upgrades as the upgrading guide says:
``uv tool install --reinstall <this checkout>`` and ``piloop upgrade``. Then every row, ref, commit and file of the
release is still there, the migrations rewrote only what the guide lists (the agents' subjects, the leases' jobs, the
events that named a run, the stored configs' ``agents``), the backup is the database before the migration, the new
code cancels one agent and scores the other's run, the removed keys fail as unknown keys, and the store restores what
both piloops archived.

A home of 0.3 is refused, untouched, with the release to install first.

Claude only: the release does not know the other harnesses' flags of today.
