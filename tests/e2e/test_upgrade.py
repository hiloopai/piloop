"""An upgrade from the last release to this checkout loses nothing, with a run in flight, on a home with real work.

    uv run pytest -m e2e tests/e2e/test_upgrade.py -rA [--e2e-model <model>]

piloop ``RELEASE`` from PyPI runs a small enwik8 campaign: a keep, a discard, a cancelled run, notes, an archive of the
keep's workspace files and a ``research/`` loss table. Its ``piloop.toml`` has a role on the herdr runtime and keys
that this checkout removed. While two agents of the release work, the user upgrades as the upgrading guide says: to
``STEP`` first, with ``piloop restart``, then ``uv tool install --reinstall <this checkout>`` and ``piloop upgrade``.
The upgrade refuses the campaign on herdr and changes nothing; the user moves it off herdr with piloop 0.2, as the
refusal says, and upgrades again. Then every row,
ref, commit and file of the release is still there, the migrations rewrote only what the guide lists (event payloads,
run ends, archive manifests, stored configs), the backup is the database before the migration, the new code cancels
one agent and scores the other's run, the removed keys fail with a link to the guide, and the store restores what
both piloops archived.

A home of 0.1.0 is refused, untouched, with the release to install first.

Claude only: the release does not know the other harnesses' flags of today.
