"""A small campaign on a piloop server that runs elsewhere, driven only through its API and the CLI, as its users drive it.

    PILOOP_HTTPS_TOKEN=<token> uv run pytest -m e2e tests/e2e/test_remote.py -rA --e2e-server https://piloop.example.com \
        [--e2e-secret ANTHROPIC_API_KEY] [--e2e-campaign <name>] [--e2e-harness claude] [--e2e-model <model>]

The server is any ``piloop serve --listen`` that this machine reaches with a bearer token in ``PILOOP_HTTPS_TOKEN``, of
``act`` access. A person registers a toy repository by its URL, files a seed and writes to the orchestrator. piloop
launches the orchestrator on the server's workers, and it answers the message. The tests also act as an orchestrator from
the CLI (``PILOOP_SERVER``): they add an idea, develop the seed, pause, resume and stop the campaign, fork it, and reopen
it. Two implementers run on the server's workers, and their candidates are judged.

The toy is published as a secret gist (``gh``, logged in with the ``gist`` scope), which the server clones: the server
needs to reach github.com. Its ``piloop.toml`` gives the harness each ``--e2e-secret`` from the server's secret of that
name. Its campaign has the same name on each run (``--e2e-campaign``, default ``e2e-remote``): the scenario retires a
campaign of that name that an earlier run left, and retires its own at the end. The gist is deleted at the end. About
3 minutes and 0.2 USD on ``claude-haiku-4-5``, mostly cache reads.
