"""The life of one small campaign, with real agents, on the enwik8 example: pause, cancel, judge, stop.

    make e2e
    uv run pytest -m e2e tests/e2e/test_lifecycle.py -rA [--e2e-harness claude] [--e2e-model <model>]

Three ideas run with two implementers. The slow one is cancelled, lzma is judged, and the campaign stops while bz2 runs.
About 3 minutes and 0.45 USD in each mode (``tests/e2e/conftest.py``).

The tests are the steps of this one campaign. They run in the order of this file, and read the state that earlier
tests leave on the ``Campaign``. ``@needs(...)`` names those earlier tests: when one of them did not pass, the test is
skipped with that reason. So ``-k`` on a test that needs others skips it: select its needs too.
