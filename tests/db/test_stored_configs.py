"""The stored configs of real homes migrate through the current chain and validate.

``tests/fixtures/configs/<revision>-<n>.json`` is a ``campaigns.config`` as a real home stored it at that revision,
structure only: its keys, tables and value types, with every path, name, command and text replaced. Together, the
files of a revision hold every key and value type that those homes stored at it. Only a revision that this piloop
migrates from has files: the head of the previous minor release, or a newer one.
