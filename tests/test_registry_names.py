"""No module outside the leaves names an entry of a registry: a built-in harness, runtime, role or trigger.

And every capability of the plugin host states its tier, and the contract of a pure one is data in, data out.

A module that needs a property of an entry asks the registry for it, so that an entry that a package or a campaign adds
gets the same treatment. Only the module that defines an entry, and the files listed here with their reason, may name it.

- The harnesses (``plugins/harness/``), the triggers (``plugins/trigger/`` and each component's ``trigger/``) and
  ``ids.py`` (the built-in roles) define the entries. The migrations, core's and each campaign type's, are history.
- ``db/models.py`` and the evaluation component's ``tables.py``: the states ``seed`` and ``stopped``, and
  ``measurements.stopped``, which share a name with a trigger.
- ``actor.py``: the outside orchestrator, ``orchestrator``, one party with the agents of the role.
- ``daemon/api.py``: ``news``, the operation id of the route that ``piloop inbox wait`` reads.
- the backlog component's ``role/research.py``: the default ``model`` of research.
- ``plugins/role/`` and each component's ``role/``: the default ``triggers`` of the built-in roles, named by kind as in
  ``piloop.toml``: a class would load its provider, and with it the database, when the config models load.
- ``deprecated.py``: the bridges rewrite the keys of earlier releases, which named built-in roles and triggers.
- the backlog's ``cli.py``, ``plugins/role/contract.py`` and ``plugins/role/orchestrator.py``: the commands ``piloop
  idea seed`` and ``piloop sql``, and ``orchestrator`` among the names that a new role may not take: the outside
  orchestrator signs with it.
- ``plugins/archive/local/archiver.py``: ``research/`` is a folder of the shared workspace, not the role.
