"""The lineage follows the campaign's verdict rule: the bar of a run, the keeps that raise it, the head,
and what follows a keep that lacks the head.

The built-in rule's lineage is pinned by the run controller's and the scheduler's tests. These select a rule that
changes one method, and check that core asks it.
