"""``keep_cost``: tell a human when a keep costs too much, and stop at a harder line. No state, no I/O.

The rule compares the fact ``spend`` names, since the latest keep, with its value per keep so far. Past ``escalate_at``
times, it asks a human once for each keep; past ``stop_at`` times, it stops the campaign. It is the built-in rule
``limits`` with these two lines, so ``max_hours``, ``hold_at`` and the others still apply. Before the first keep there
is no value per keep, and the rule is ``limits``.
