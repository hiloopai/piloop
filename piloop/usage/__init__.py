"""Token usage of each agent, kept in ``agent_sessions.usage``.

piloop reads the usage from the files that the agent's harness leaves when the agent ends (``Harness.usage``). The
result is a ``Usage``, with the same meaning for every harness, so one ``json_extract`` reads it in SQL and the
harnesses compare. ``input`` is the uncached input, ``cache_read`` and ``cache_write`` are the input read from and
written to the prompt cache. ``total`` is what the harness itself counts as the session's tokens.
