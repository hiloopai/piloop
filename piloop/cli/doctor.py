"""``piloop doctor``: read-only checks of an install. Each failure says how to fix it, with the command when there is one.

The checks note a newer piloop at the source of the CLI, and find what can break after an upgrade: a daemon that still
runs the old code, a database behind the code, a secrets command that fails, a ``piloop.toml`` that the new code refuses,
an MCP server that cannot start, skills that are missing or out of date, a missing harness, and what each vcs provider
checks itself (``Vcs.checks``). Nothing here writes: the database is opened read-only, and nothing starts. The check of the source asks the network (``git ls-remote`` or the package index). The commands that the
lines name use ``Settings.cli``. ``piloop upgrade`` runs the checks last.
