"""The vcs capability: how a campaign saves versions of its files, and how agents and jobs work on them.

A **version** is one saved state of the campaign's files, with its metadata (``Version``). The provider names it by its
**revision**: a commit SHA under ``git``. Core stores, compares and ships revisions, and never parses one.

Host tier: a provider runs processes and writes files. ``[plugins.vcs] provider`` in ``piloop.toml`` selects one
(``git`` by default). A provider is its parameters, a ``Vcs`` whose ``open`` returns the ``Repository`` of a checkout.
A job names the campaign's provider with its parameters (``Source.vcs``), so a worker uses the same one. Versions travel
between machines through the CAS (``Transfer``).

Like Jujutsu's ``Backend`` and Sapling's storage: core asks the contract for versions, never the tool behind it.
