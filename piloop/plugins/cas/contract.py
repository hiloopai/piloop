"""The CAS capability: the content-addressed store that archived files, manifests and job data live in.

A blob's address is a covalence ``Cid``: BLAKE3, hash only. The contract, ``Cas``, is a subset of covalence's Python
``Cas`` with the same names and signatures, so a ``covalence.Cas`` is a provider's store as it is. A missing blob reads
as None. A blob whose bytes do not match its CID raises covalence's ``IntegrityError``, and a failure of the storage
underneath its ``StoreError``.

Host tier: a provider does I/O. ``[plugins.cas] provider`` in ``config.toml`` selects one (``disk`` by default), and
the other keys of the table are its parameters: a provider is its parameters, a ``CasProvider`` whose ``open`` returns
the ``Cas``. A store that keeps blobs in tiers also implements ``Upkeep``.
