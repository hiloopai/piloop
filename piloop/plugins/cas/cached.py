"""``cached``: a local tier over a remote CAS, as a cache that keeps every blob it holds on the remote too.

The local tier is any ``LocalProvider`` (``disk`` by default), the remote any provider. Each blob put is stored in both
and marked ``blake3/<digest>/remote`` under the local tier's root, beside its bytes on a ``disk``: the layout of
piloop 0.2, whose homes open in place. ``remote.url`` there names the remote that the markers mean. ``flush`` (``Upkeep``) uploads what is not
marked yet, then drops the local bytes of marked blobs by age and by the directory's size. A read of a dropped blob
fetches it back, and so does a read of a blob that another store put on the remote: a server and its workers share
one bucket, each through a store of its own. With ``evict_after_days = 0`` the local tier is a staging area: a put
goes to the remote alone, and a read streams from it.

Blobs move between the tiers through the ``Cas`` protocol, as content: each upload and each fetch decompresses and
compresses again, through a temporary file of the blob's full size. A flush uploaded a 512 MiB JSON blob (145 MiB
stored) in 14 s over a local ``disk`` remote, where a copy of its object takes 0.1 s. That cost goes with this module.

Retirement: deleted when covalence's ``Cas.cached`` ships with eviction, usage and this marker layout, and ``cached``
opens it instead.
