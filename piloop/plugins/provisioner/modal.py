"""``modal``: each worker of the pool is a Modal Sandbox that runs ``piloop worker`` in the image that you name.

```toml
[plugins.executor.pools.gpu.provisioner.compute]
provider = "modal"
image = "ghcr.io/acme/piloop-worker:0.3"
gpu = "A100"
secrets = ["piloop-cas"]
registry = { kind = "aws-ecr", secret = "piloop-ecr-pull" }
```

The image has ``piloop`` on its ``PATH``, with the evaluator runners and harnesses that the pool's jobs need. Each
sandbox gets the worker's credential in a Modal Secret of its own, never in its command, and the named ``secrets``
beside it. Its tags name its worker, its pool and this server's owner, so ``list`` finds this server's sandboxes alone.

Modal Secrets are for what the sandbox needs before any job runs: the credentials that pull its image (``registry``),
and those of the worker process itself (its CAS's, when the worker reads the bucket). What a job needs, such as a
harness's API key or a gateway URL, comes from piloop's ``secrets`` capability when the job starts, fenced by its
lease, and is never a Modal Secret: a Modal Secret is in the environment of every job on the sandbox.

Modal ends a sandbox after ``timeout_hours`` (24 at most): its lease then expires, and the pool starts another one if a
job still waits.

The server needs Modal's credentials (``MODAL_TOKEN_ID`` and ``MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET``, or ``modal token new``), and the
``modal`` extra (``uv tool install 'piloop[modal]'``), imported when the pool's provisioner opens.
