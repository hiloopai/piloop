"""``Readings``: a fact source of named values that the daemon reads every ``interval`` seconds.

Each reading is a ``fact.read`` event on the campaign, the one record of its values. The source supplies each name
that it reads (``reading``), and how much its value grew since the latest keep (``since_keep``), from those events. It
posts a note at each of its ``notices``, and an escalation when its readings start to fail.
