"""Facts: what a campaign knows about where it is, as typed keys that its fact sources supply.

A ``Fact`` is a typed key, as a ``contextvars.ContextVar`` is: its name, and the type of its value in its parameter.
The campaign's fact sources (``[plugins.fact_source] use``, ``piloop.plugins.fact_source.contract``) supply them. A stop rule or a
section names the facts it reads and gets ``Facts``: those values, and None for one that its source does not know yet.

This module imports only the Python standard library, so a pure provider can import it. It also has the keys of
piloop's own sources, so that a rule names them once: those of ``campaign`` (``CAMPAIGN``) and of ``optimization``
(``OPTIMIZATION``), and ``reading`` and ``since_keep`` for the values that a source such as ``command`` reads.
