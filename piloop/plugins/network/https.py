"""``https``, the built-in network: bearer tokens (``piloop token``), over TLS that the server or a proxy ends.

```toml
[plugins.network]
provider = "https"
listen = "0.0.0.0:8443"
tls = { cert = "/etc/piloop/cert.pem", key = "/etc/piloop/key.pem" }
```

A server that other machines can reach and that has no TLS would send its tokens in the clear: an address that is not
loopback needs ``tls``. ``tls = "proxy"`` says that TLS ends in front of the server, at a reverse proxy or an SSH
tunnel. A machine that dials the server sends the token in ``PILOOP_HTTPS_TOKEN``. A worker that the server starts gets
a token of its own, and dials ``url``.
