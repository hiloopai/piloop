"""The network capability: how other machines reach the server of ``piloop serve --listen``, and who a caller is.

Host tier: a provider binds a socket and makes HTTP clients. ``[plugins.network] provider`` in ``config.toml`` selects
one (``https`` by default). The entry point names a ``NetworkConfig`` class, whose fields are the other keys of the
table and always have ``listen``, which ``piloop serve --listen`` overrides. Its ``open`` makes the server's
``Network``, and its ``client`` dials a server.

What a caller may do once it is known is core's (``piloop.net``), not the provider's.
