"""``proxy``: a server behind a proxy that authenticates every request and stamps who sent it in headers.

```toml
[plugins.network]
provider = "proxy"
listen = "0.0.0.0:8443"
url = "https://piloop.example.com"
claims = { org = "x-org-id", kind = "x-subject-kind", user = "x-user-id", principal = "x-principal" }
name_claims = ["user", "principal"]
rules = [
  { when = { org = "acme", principal = "key-0123" }, access = "worker" },
  { when = { org = "acme", kind = "service_account" }, access = "act", caller = "service" },
  { when = { org = "acme" }, access = "act" },
]
```

The proxy (Envoy's ext_authz, an oauth2-proxy, a cloud load balancer's authentication) checks each caller's own
credential, removes any copy of its headers that the caller sent, and stamps its own. ``claims`` names those headers;
``rules`` give a caller its access by the values of its claims, the first rule that matches winning, as Envoy's RBAC and
Envoy Gateway's authorization rules do; a caller that no rule matches is refused. A worker is named by the
``worker_header`` that it sends, anyone else by the first of its ``name_claims`` that is not empty. That name signs a
person's writes as ``human:<name>``, unless the rule's ``caller`` is ``service``: ``service:<name>``.

This network checks no token of its own, and core refuses piloop's own tokens (``plt_``) on its listener, so
``listen`` must be reachable from the proxy alone, by a network policy or a firewall: whoever reaches it can claim
anything. TLS ends at the proxy.

Workers share one credential that the proxy accepts, which its ``worker`` rule matches. ``enroll`` hands a provisioned
worker that credential, from the home's secret ``worker_credential_secret`` (``piloop secret set``), and its name.
``revoke`` has nothing to end: the provisioner stops the worker's machine, and revoking the credential at the proxy
ends every worker.
