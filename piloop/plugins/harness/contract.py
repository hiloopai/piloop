"""The harnesses: the coding-agent CLIs that piloop launches (``[plugins.harness.<name>]`` in ``piloop.toml``).

A harness is a provider of ``HARNESSES``. Its fields are the keys of its table: the program, the argv of a headless
run and of a resumed one, its home, its environment. A provider gives them their defaults, and its methods hold all
that piloop knows about its CLI: how it takes the MCP servers of a role (``mcp``), where its session files are and
how to read their tokens (``usage``), what its hook prints for a message (``messages``) and where it reads user skills
(``skills_dir``). The built-in providers are ``pi``, ``claude`` and ``codex``.

A campaign has an instance of every provider, by its name, over the provider's defaults. A table with another name is a
new harness: with ``provider = "<name>"`` it is that provider over its defaults, else a ``Custom`` harness, which runs
its argv and does nothing else. The rotation (``[plugins.harness] use``) defaults to the providers that are ``DEFAULT``.
