    """``limits``: hold while a fact of ``hold_at`` is unknown or at its limit, else stop at the first limit reached.

    ``[plugins.stop_rule]`` sets the limits. One is enough. Without one, the campaign has no end.

    The daemon checks the limits on every pass, before it requests anything. When one is reached, the campaign is
    ``stopped`` (``campaigns.status``, ``stopped_reason``). Running implementers are told to save their work and stop, and
    are ended 10 minutes later. What they saved is scored. Most harnesses read the message only when the turn ends: an
    implementer that is ended before it left its finding ends its run ``campaign_stopped``, which does not count toward
    ``max_runs`` or ``plateau``. Pending requests and queued runs are dropped (``campaign_stopped``). Once the last
    commits are scored, the ``stopped`` triggers fire once, which by default requests the watchdog's closing review,
    and the triggers request nothing more. The daemon files no seeds for the campaign either. An agent that you request with ``piloop launch`` after
    the stop still starts.

    ``piloop campaign stop`` stops a campaign the same way at once, whatever the limits are. With ``--kill``,
    the implementers are ended at once instead of told. ``piloop init`` resumes a stopped campaign when its limits
    changed.

    ``max_runs`` counts the runs that reached the evaluator, with a candidate that is measured or waits for its
    measurement. A run that ended at a cheap check with no version, with only versions that asked to be skipped, or
    before it saved one because of a harness or host fault, says nothing about the metric, so it does not count.
    ``plateau`` counts every finished attempt without a keep, these too: a campaign whose runs never submit plateaus.
    A run that a daemon stop, a daemon crash or a campaign stop ended counts toward neither. ``hold_at``,
    ``max_tokens`` and ``max_hours`` stay hard limits on what all runs cost.

    The hold comes first: a limit does not stop a held campaign. A stop that someone requests still stops it
    (``piloop.campaign.stop.requested``). The stops come in the order of ``STOPS``. ``max_runs`` also waits until no
    attempt is unsettled, because one that ends without a scored candidate does not count.
