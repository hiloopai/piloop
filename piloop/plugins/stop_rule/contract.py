"""The contract of a stop rule: the types that piloop gives a stop rule, and the types that the rule returns.

On each pass of the daemon, piloop asks the stop rule of each active campaign whether the campaign goes on, holds, or
stops. It asks in two steps. First it calls ``reads``: the rule names the facts that it needs. piloop gets only those
facts. Then it calls ``check`` with a ``StopCase``: those facts. The rule returns one answer:

- ``Go``: piloop starts what the campaign needs, within what ``left`` says is left of each fact.
- ``Hold``: piloop starts no agent and no evaluation for the campaign. Work that runs finishes. The hold is not a
  pause: on each pass piloop asks again, and the hold ends when the rule answers ``Go``.
- ``Stop``: piloop stops the campaign.
- ``Escalate``: piloop tells a human why, one priority-0 escalation for each distinct reason, and then acts on its
  ``then``: by default, the campaign goes on. A rule escalates itself: piloop posts no escalation of its own for a
  hold.

``describe`` returns the rule's own view of the campaign against its limits, for ``piloop status`` and the briefs:
piloop formats none of the facts itself.

The rule reads nothing else: it is a pure provider. ``[plugins.stop_rule] provider`` in ``piloop.toml`` selects the
rule, and the other keys of that table are its fields, its limits among them. Without the table, the rule is
``limits``. ``check_config`` refuses a campaign that the rule cannot serve, when the file loads.

A fact is a typed key (``piloop.plugins.fact_source.facts``) that a fact source of the campaign supplies, by its name.
Every fact that a rule reads needs a source in the campaign.

This module imports only the Python standard library, the plugin host, the facts and the metric types. A rule imports
this module and the facts it reads, and nothing else of piloop.
