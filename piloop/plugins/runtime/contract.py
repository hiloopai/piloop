The daemon and the CLI depend only on the ``Runtime`` protocol, and never on the name of a runtime. To add a runtime
(a container, a remote host), subclass ``RuntimeConfig``, whose ``open`` returns your ``Runtime``, and register the
subclass with an entry point in the group of ``RUNTIMES``. Its fields are its settings, from ``[plugins.runtime.<name>]`` of
``config.toml``: they depend on the machine, not on the campaign.
