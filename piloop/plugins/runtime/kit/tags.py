"""The process tag: how a runtime finds and ends every process of an agent, also one that left the agent's session.

A runtime starts each agent with ``TAG_ENV`` set to a random value of its own, and every process that the agent starts
inherits it. The tag says nothing about who the agent is: ``PILOOP_ACTOR`` does. ``piloop.proc.child_env`` drops it,
so a daemon or an evaluation that an agent's ``piloop`` command starts does not die with the agent.
