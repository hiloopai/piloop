"""The plugin host: the one way that piloop finds, checks, activates, shows and tears down what plugins provide.

Terms:

- A **capability** is a public interface with a registry of named providers: the executors, the verdict rules, the
  runtimes. It declares its contract, a class, and where the configuration has its instances: one at
  ``[plugins.<name>]`` (``One``), several at ``[plugins.<name>.<instance>]`` (``Many``), or a table that holds one
  (``Entry``). A field that names an instance is a reference (``Ref``).
- An **instance** is a provider with its parameters: the table ``{ provider = "<name>", <its parameters> }``, wherever
  it is.
- A **provider** is a class that subclasses the contract, named by an entry point whose name is the provider's name.
  It is a ``Parameters`` model: its fields are its parameters, and its methods are the contract. The host validates
  its table into it once, when the file loads.
- A **plugin** is an installed Python package whose entry points name providers. piloop's own providers are entry
  points of the ``piloop`` package, in the same groups. A provider's ``PythonSource`` says which one, and its version.
- A **tier** is what the contract of a capability lets cross to a provider (``Tier``): live objects of the host, or
  data only. Everything else is the same for both tiers.

Lifecycle:

- A capability activates on first use (``Capability.providers``), or with others in ``compose``. It loads every
  provider, checks each one, and registers all of them or none: no consumer sees part of a registry.
- A provider that looks another capability up while it loads activates that one first.
- When an activation fails, ``compose`` unregisters what it activated, newest first, and raises a ``PluginError`` that
  names the entry point. ``close`` unregisters everything, newest first; the next use activates again.
- The registrations are owned effects on a ``contextlib.ExitStack``. A provider that holds a resource puts its cleanup
  on the same stack when a capability first needs one.

Inspiration:

- pluggy: providers found through entry points, each with the distribution that declares it.
- Cordis (DeepSeek Harness): registrations as owned, reversible effects; a failed activation unwinds what it did.
- The OpenTelemetry Collector: a component's configuration, validated with its defaults, makes the live component,
  and ``<type>/<name>`` names one of several instances of a type, which a pipeline lists by name.
- The WebAssembly component model: pure contracts of data only, and errors as values.
