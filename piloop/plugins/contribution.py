"""What a provider or a capability adds to core while the daemon runs: its ``Contribution``.

The daemon asks each provider that it opened once, in the order that it opened them, then each capability that runs
machinery of its own (``CONTRIBUTORS``), then each installed provider of a capability that a campaign chooses, built
with its defaults (``installed``). It hands the result to its loop and its server (``collect``). What a package adds
before anything opens, it declares in a ``Slot`` (``piloop.plugins.host``).

Inspiration: Backstage's backend plugins, which register their routers, scheduled tasks and startup and shutdown hooks
with the core services.
