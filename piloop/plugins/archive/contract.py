"""The archive capability: moves the finished parts of campaign workspaces into the CAS, and writes them back.

``[plugins.archive]`` in ``config.toml`` chooses the home's provider: ``local`` by default. The daemon opens it once
(``open``), and runs its consumer (``Archiver.contribution``). A part of a workspace is final when its subject settles
(``piloop.db.events.SubjectSettled``), and the rest when its campaign stops. When a campaign is retired, its files leave
the disk for the CAS (``CampaignFilesFreed``).
