"""Archiving the shared workspace into the CAS, and restoring it: the campaign side of ``piloop.store.tree``.

Agents write to ``<PILOOP_HOME>/projects/<id>/workspace`` and nothing used to delete it: on one machine it grew to
hundreds of gigabytes in millions of files, most of them copies. What the store owes (``due``), from the event feed and
core's tables alone:

- a subject settled (``subject.settled``, for example a done idea): every top-level entry named after it goes into the
  store;
- a campaign stopped and nothing of it runs any more: everything left in its workspace goes.

``archive`` stores a job's files, stores their manifest, checks that the store holds every blob, and records an
``archives`` row. It removes nothing: the local copies stay, so an agent or a human that still reads them finds them.
``prune`` removes them later, file by file where the file still holds what was stored: by age, or under disk pressure
(``make_room``). ``restore`` writes a subject's files, a path or everything back. The archiver decides when
(``archiver``).
