"""The worker's half of the leases library: the calls a worker makes, whatever carries them.

After the GitHub Actions runner (a session, one long-poll for messages, then acquire, renew and finish) and Buildkite
agent v3 (register, ping, accept, start, finish). ``Local`` makes the calls on ``Leases`` in this process: the worker
inside ``piloop serve`` takes that path. Another transport implements ``LeaseClient`` the same way, and the worker
does not change.
