"""The leases library over HTTP: ``Remote``, a worker's ``LeaseClient``, and ``lease_routes``, the server's half.

Each ``LeaseClient`` call is one ``POST /v1/executor/<call>`` of JSON, on the server of ``piloop serve --listen``. The
route makes the call on ``Local``, bound to the caller's principal: the worker is who its token says, never what its
body says. A refusal has a typed body, ``RefusalBody``. What ``Remote`` does with an answer:

| Status | The worker |
|---|---|
| 409 with an ``error`` of ``CONFLICTS`` | raises its exception: ``StaleLease`` stops the job, ``NotAddressed`` drops an answer to a message that was not its, ``MissingBlobs`` loses the job whose report names blobs that the server's CAS lacks, ``NotSent`` fails the job whose versions the server could not send, ``Dismissed`` ends the worker (no such pool) |
| 408, 429, 5xx, or no answer (``RETRIED``) | tries again with backoff, with the same body and so the same request id |
| any other 4xx | ``Dismissed``: stops its jobs, keeps their reports, and exits. 401: the token is unknown or revoked. 403: a token named ``serve``. 404: the server's executor takes no workers. 412: the worker's CAS is not the server's. 422 or 426: another piloop |

``messages`` and ``send`` are long-polls: the server awaits a commit between two reads (``Route.long_poll``), and holds
no thread.

After the GitHub Actions runner (``acquirejob``, ``renewjob``) and Buildkite agent v3 (``accept``, ``start``,
``finish``). A grant names its job by address in the CAS, and the job names its data so: the worker reads and writes the
CAS itself, and no bytes come through these routes. ``send`` asks the server to put the versions that the worker's
clone lacks into the CAS, and answers their addresses (``transfers``).
``secrets`` answers the values of the secrets that an agent's job names, which never go into the CAS.
