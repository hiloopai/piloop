"""The ``piloop`` calls of an agent on a worker elsewhere: its worker relays each one to the server, on its lease.

The agent's ``piloop`` (``$PILOOP_BIN``, first on its PATH) is ``door.main``. It sends its argv, and its stdin
for ``piloop sql -``, to its worker's ``Relay``, on a Unix socket, which sends them on with the worker's own credential
(``Remote.cli``, ``POST /v1/executor/cli``). The server runs the call as the agent, with its own piloop and database
(``Runner``), and sends back what it printed. The fence of the agent's lease scopes the call (``Leases.relayed``): a
call after the lease ended is refused.

An agent runs as the worker's user, as an agent of ``piloop serve`` runs as the daemon's. The socket admits only that
user, in a directory of mode 0700. Each call carries the agent's own token (``PILOOP_AGENT_TOKEN``), and the server runs
it only when the token is the lease's agent's: one agent of a worker cannot call as another.

Only the commands of the agent's role run (``RoleConfig.RELAYED``), the ones that its prompt names: a test keeps the
two in step. The call runs
in the campaign's checkout on the server, so a command that finds its campaign from the cwd finds it there.

Retirement: deleted when agents call typed operations over HTTP, if they ever do.
