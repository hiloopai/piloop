"""The capacity of a worker, after Kubernetes: a pool's allocatable slots, and the thresholds that keep jobs off a host.

A **pool** is the capacity of each worker in it (``Pool``). A worker sends a **host sample** (``HostSample``) on
every heartbeat. ``admits`` checks a pool against a sample and what the worker runs: a host under memory or load
pressure takes no job, as the node conditions of Kubernetes taint a node. Its slots then count zero.
