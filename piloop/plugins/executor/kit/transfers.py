"""The server's half of a worker's fetch: the versions that a clone lacks, from the repo of record into the CAS.

A clone that has versions names its newest (``MAX_HAVE``), and the server puts what it lacks beyond them into the CAS
(``Repository.send``), in the request. An empty clone names none, and lacks everything: the repo's first transfer.
That can take minutes for a large repo, longer than a request lasts, and every new worker asks for it. So the server
builds it once per repo, in a thread of its own, keeps its address in ``first_transfers``, and answers each empty
clone with that blob and the versions beyond it. A request that comes while it builds is a long-poll: the commit of
the row wakes it. A build past its deadline fails each request, so a hang fails jobs instead of holding their slots.

After git's bundle URIs and Mercurial's clone bundles: a new clone starts from a bundle that the server built once,
then fetches what is newer.
