"""A worker's copies of the repos of record, and the versions in and out of them through the CAS.

A job names its files by address (``Source``): a repo of record, a revision, and its links as manifests in the CAS. A
worker checks the revision out of its own clone of the repo (``Clones``), with the job's vcs provider. A version that
its clone lacks comes through the CAS: the clone names the versions it has, and the server puts the rest into the CAS
(``Repository.send``). The versions an agent saves go back the same way, and core takes them into the repo of record
(``Repository.receive``). No bytes go through the server. The worker in ``piloop serve`` takes this path too: its clone
is the repo of record.
