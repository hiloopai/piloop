"""Run one job on this machine: an agent with its runtime, or an evaluation with the evaluator runner.

Any executor can use it (``piloop.plugins.executor.contract``): ``workers`` does, for each job its worker takes, and so
can one that runs jobs inline. What the executor does around a job (track it, stop it, report it) is its
``Control``; the machine it runs on is its ``Site``. Like Airflow's ``run_workload``: one way to run a unit of work,
whichever executor placed it.

The steps of an agent's job: make its place and its artifact (a checkout, ``Clones``), write the brief, put the values
of its secrets in its environment, render the MCP servers, start the agent, watch it to its end, save its transcript,
put its session file in the CAS, read its usage, and bring its versions back. What it made goes back by address: the report names
its versions, its log files (``Site.files``) and what it wrote in the shared workspace in the CAS. The checkout stays:
the executor removes it (``remove``) once the report is out, so a worker that restarts in between finds the ended agent
there.
