"""Scaling, a building block for executors: start and stop the workers of each pool that has a provisioner.

A pool with ``[…provisioner]`` (``capacity.Provisioner``) has between ``min`` and ``max`` workers, which its
provisioner starts and stops (``piloop.plugins.provisioner``). The pool counts the slots of ``max`` workers
(``Leases.capacity``), so its jobs queue on leases, and the queued leases are the demand. One pass, for each provisioned
pool in config order:

| Step | Rule |
|---|---|
| waiting | The queued leases that the pool's workers can run: a kind of job that it has slots for, and a job of another kind with one of its ``runners``. |
| covered | The free slots of the reachable workers of any pool that can run them, and the slots of the workers that still start, in any provisioned pool. |
| need | The workers for what waits and is not covered. With ``once``: one for each lease. |
| start | Up to ``min``, or the need, below ``max``. At most ``max_starting`` at once, and none during a backoff or past ``max_worker_hours_per_day``. |
| drain | The workers past ``max``; those past ``min`` that held no lease for ``idle_seconds``; a ``once`` worker that ran its lease. |

A drained worker takes no more leases (``NoLease.DRAINING``), and exits once each of its jobs reported. Once it holds
no lease, the pass stops its instance. The cluster autoscaler, Ray's autoscaler and Buildkite's elastic stack decide
the same way, and Slurm's power saving times out a node that never comes up (``register_seconds``).

The ``worker_instances`` row of an instance commits before its start, and its credential is minted then
(``Network.enroll``), so a daemon that restarts finds every instance that it asked for. The provisioner's ``list`` runs
at the first pass and then every ``RESYNC_SECONDS``: an instance that it lists with this server's owner and no row is
an orphan, and is stopped. Every change of a row is an ``instance.*`` event on it.

The pass runs on a thread of its own, at most one at a time, so a slow platform never holds the daemon's loop. The
executor's upkeep starts one when the feed has a change that the pass acts on (``WAKES``), or at the pass's next
deadline.
