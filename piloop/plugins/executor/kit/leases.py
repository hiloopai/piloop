"""Leases, a building block for executors: how a job reaches a worker, wherever it runs, and how its report is fenced.

Core does not use this module: an executor opts in. The built-in ``workers`` executor runs every job on a lease, with
its worker in ``piloop serve``; remote workers take leases through the same operations. The words:

- A **lease** is a time-limited claim on one job by one worker. ``Leases.submit`` puts the job's description in the
  CAS and inserts the lease ``queued`` with its address. A worker acquires it, reads the job from the CAS, starts it,
  renews the lease with a heartbeat, and reports.
- A **fencing token** is a number that grows with each new lease of a job: the lease id. A report with an old token
  is refused (``StaleLease``), so a worker that was presumed dead can't overwrite newer work. Its report stays as a
  ``lease.stale_report`` event on the job's row, with the addresses of what it brought back in the CAS.
- The **grace period** (``Timing.grace``, 50 s) is the silence after which a worker is unreachable: its slots count
  zero until it is heard again. After the **toleration** (``Timing.toleration``,
  300 s) its leases **expire**: a run ends ``worker_lost``, which is not an attempt, and an evaluation is queued
  again on a new lease. A worker that hears nothing for that long, less two heartbeats, stops its own jobs first, so a
  job never runs twice.

The timing is the two stages of Kubernetes: node leases (the kubelet renews every 10 s), the unreachable taint after
``--node-monitor-grace-period``, and eviction after the taint's ``tolerationSeconds`` of 300.

Each worker has a row in ``lease_workers``: its pool (``capacity.Pool``) and the host sample of its last call. A worker
takes a job only while ``capacity.admits`` it, and ``Leases.capacity`` sums the slots of the reachable workers that
are not under pressure.

A worker's messages are events on the job's row (``LeaseQueued``, ``LeasePrompted``, ``LeaseRevoked``), or on the
worker's instance (``WorkerDrained``), each written in the transaction of the change that it announces: a
transactional outbox. A worker reads those of its ``topics``
after its cursor (``piloop.db.feed``), which it moves past a prompt only once it answered ``queued``, as a NATS
JetStream consumer moves its ack floor. So a message survives a restart of the daemon or the worker.

The fence is the executor's, not core's: core checks only the domain (``Settled``). Every operation that checks it
runs in one write transaction with the core operation that it guards (``Results``), so a report, a heartbeat and an
expiry never both apply. The ``leases`` table is core's; ``lease_workers`` is the schema ``executor/workers``'s
(``piloop.plugins.executor.kit.tables``).
