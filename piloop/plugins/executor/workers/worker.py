"""A worker of the ``workers`` executor: takes leases (``piloop.plugins.executor.kit.leases``) and runs their jobs on this machine (``piloop.plugins.executor.kit.jobs``).

``piloop serve`` runs one (``SERVE``). It reports each job when it ends. It reads no campaign table: everything
comes in the job's description, which it reads from the CAS, and everything goes back in the report, by address in the
CAS (``jobs.Site``).

It talks to its control plane only through a ``LeaseClient``: ``Local`` in ``piloop serve``, ``Remote`` in ``piloop
worker --server``. One thread sends a heartbeat with a host sample (``Timing.renew``), takes new jobs and resends
unsent reports, from ``start`` until the worker stops. Another reads the worker's messages (a long-poll): a waiting job wakes the first at once, a revoke stops
a job, an extension moves its deadline, and a prompt goes to its agent. Each job has a thread of its own.
A worker that hears nothing back for ``Timing.self_stop`` stops its jobs and keeps their reports until it is heard
again: by then the fence refuses them, and a person can still import what they made (``leases.StaleReport``). A
report is kept in the worker's spool (``Spool``) until the control plane took or refused it, so a worker that is
killed sends it again when it starts. A worker that the control plane refuses for good (``Dismissed``) stops its jobs
and ends. A drained one (``Drain``, ``NoLease.DRAINING``), one that runs ``once``, and one that held no lease for
``orphan_exit`` seconds (its server did not answer), takes no more jobs, and ends once each job reported.
