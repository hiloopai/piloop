"""The ``workers`` executor, built in: lease-based workers (``piloop.plugins.executor.kit.leases``), in-process by default.

``[plugins.executor]`` in ``config.toml`` selects it (the default) and sets its fields (``Workers``). Its worker in
``piloop serve`` takes the leases of the pool ``serve``. A worker on another machine (``piloop worker --server``) takes
those of its pool, through the same lease operations over HTTP (``piloop.plugins.executor.kit.remote``). A pool with a
provisioner gets its workers started and stopped on demand (``piloop.plugins.executor.kit.scaling``).
