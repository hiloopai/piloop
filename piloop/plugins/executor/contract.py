"""The executor capability: how jobs reach the machines that run them, and how their results come back.

A **job** is one agent session or one evaluation, described as data (``AgentJob``, ``EvaluationJob``): what to check
out, what to run, what to bring back. Core decides what runs (the planner, the roles, the evaluation queue); the
executor decides where and how, and keeps track of it. When a job starts, ends or is lost, the executor calls the core
operations (``Results``), which change the campaign's rows. Like Airflow's executors (``LocalExecutor``,
``CeleryExecutor``): core queues work and reads results, and the executor owns the workers.

Host tier: an executor runs processes. ``[plugins.executor] provider`` in ``config.toml`` selects one (``workers`` by
default). The entry point names an ``ExecutorConfig`` class, whose fields are the other keys of the table, and the
daemon calls its ``open`` once to make the ``Executor``.

Core enforces the domain's invariants only: a job's row closes once, a measurement is recorded once. An executor that
can deliver a result twice, or late (a worker presumed dead), protects the work itself: ``workers`` does it with leases
and fencing tokens, checked inside the session in which it calls ``Results``. What counts as lost work, and how to
protect it, is the executor's choice.
