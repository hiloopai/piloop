    The campaign has stalled when the runs since the last keep reach the stall mark, ``every``. Each further mark of
    runs without a keep is a new step, and a keep ends the stall. The backlog may hold no idea that pivots, and the
    brief of a sweep on a stall allows one idea of the role's own. So a stall of N runs gets about N / mark sweeps, not
    one per result. The back-off of ``low_water`` for new results still applies, and a killed sweep is retried at the
    next step. As with ``low_water``, nothing is requested while every slot of the role is busy, while its
    ``max_ideas`` is 0, or while the queue holds its ideas for the head (``Backlog.on_hold``).
