"""Experimental: the context of a scout sweep (``[plugins.role.scout]``), which files outside techniques as seeds.

A scout sweep runs ``prompts/scout.md`` and signs ``<role>#<agent session id>``. So its seeds have their own row in the
keeps-by-source count (``piloop.plugins.campaign_type.kit.backlog.ideas.yields``), next to research's own ideas.

The scout's memory is the database. The technique library is the ``techniques`` table. The watch list is computed,
not stored: the X handles and GitHub repos linked from the role's seeds that research developed or that kept. A
source stays on the list until ``WATCH_RUNS`` sweeps of the role have started since one of its seeds last paid off. A
source with a keep stays.
