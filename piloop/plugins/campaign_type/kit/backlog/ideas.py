"""Ideas: their links, the actions on them, where they come from and what each source produced.

Links (``idea_links``) are *after* and *supersedes*. The rules are on ``Idea`` in the models. This module holds
their SQL and their text. The scheduler uses it to find the ``ready`` ideas that can run and to reject superseded
ideas. The status and history renderers use it to show the links in one cell. Add the rule for a new kind of link
here.

``reprioritise`` changes an idea's priority. ``piloop.campaign.ops`` holds the other changes to an idea.
``yields`` measures each source by its keeps, not by the number of ideas it inserted. The overview and the research
pack show it.

Seeds: every role except the implementer can file a hunch with pointers (``seed``). Research develops a seed into a
defined idea (``develop``) or rejects it. ``defined_by`` returns the agents that added a defined idea to the campaign.
This is how piloop measures the work of a research sweep.
