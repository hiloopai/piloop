"""The contract of a verdict rule: the types that piloop gives a rule, and the type that the rule returns.

After piloop measures a candidate, it asks the verdict rule whether to keep the candidate. It calls the rule's
``decide`` with a ``Case``: the measurements of the candidate, the measurements of its bar (the candidate that it must
beat), and the metrics that decide. The rule returns a ``Judgement``: ``keep``, ``interesting``, ``discard`` or
``crash``, and a reason. piloop stores both on the candidate.

The rule also decides the lineage: the bar of a run (``bar``), which keeps raise it (``raises_bar``), the head
(``head``), and what follows a keep that lacks the head (``on_moved``). Each method but ``decide`` has the built-in behaviour as
its default.

The rule reads nothing else: it is a pure provider. ``[plugins.verdict_rule] provider`` in ``piloop.toml`` selects the
rule, and the other keys of that table are its fields. Without the table, the rule is ``bootstrap``.

This module imports only the Python standard library, the plugin host, the ids and the metric types. A rule imports this
module, and nothing else of piloop.
