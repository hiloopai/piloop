"""The evaluation queue (``evaluations``): the evaluations that the daemon runs now or next, one row each.

The daemon submits each evaluation to its executor when one of the executor's slots is free (``Executor.capacity``),
in this order (``waiting``), whichever the executor. A free slot goes to the
campaign with the fewest running evaluations, and in that campaign to its head first, then to the oldest request. So a
campaign with many requests never holds back the requests of another, and inside a campaign each request waits only
for the ones before it. The queue is in the database: ``view`` answers it, and ``cancel`` takes from it.

A remeasure that someone asked for (``ledger.request_remeasure``) enters the queue only when the daemon gets to it, one
per campaign at a time. Until then ``requested`` lists its pending request, so ``piloop eval queue`` shows it from the
moment it is asked.
