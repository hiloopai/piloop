"""The research pack: the context that the daemon gives each research sweep.

Ideas written with broad context produce more keeps. The daemon builds this pack from the database and the campaign
repo when a sweep that proposes work starts. ``piloop history`` prints it too. It contains:

- the metrics with their roles, tracks, margins and floors, and the start and the head on each;
- the analysis artifacts (``context``) and the shared workspace, newest first, as file pointers
  with an outline;
- what was tried, by family (``ideas.family``), and the seeds that other roles filed for research to develop;
- the history (``piloop.plugins.campaign_type.optimization.history``);
- the latest implementer findings, and the digests and decisions of the orchestrator and the human, by id and first
  line.

The ideas by source and the open escalations are in the campaign overview, which every sweep also reads.

The size is bounded. Each list keeps its latest rows, as many as ``Shown`` says, a comment is its first line, and files
are pointers, not inlined content.
