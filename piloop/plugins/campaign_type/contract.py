"""The campaign type capability: what one kind of campaign stores, how it runs and what it shows.

``campaigns.type`` names the type of a campaign. Every installed type's schema is migrated. ``optimization``, built in,
is the research model: ideas, runs, candidates and their evaluations. In the daemon, a type plans its campaigns through
the hooks of its ``Planner``, which the campaigns' pass calls in one transaction.
