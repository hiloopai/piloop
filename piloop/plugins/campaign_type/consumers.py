"""The campaign type capability's machinery: the pass over the campaigns, and the agents that it launches.

The pass has two phases. First, each campaign's type and the triggers of its roles
(https://piloop.autoresearch.inc/concepts/roles) insert ``agent_sessions`` rows in state ``requested``. Then the
requested rows launch in id order, as far as the role's ``max_concurrent`` allows, while the executor has a free agent
slot (``Executor.capacity``). A free slot goes to the campaign with the fewest live agents, as the evaluation queue
gives its slots. Anyone can insert a requested row by hand, for example the CLI or an agent. Such a row launches in
the same second phase.

        an incident sweep: its sections read them (``Rendering.given``), and the brief adds the role's incident prompt.

        progress review. Nothing that a sweep commits is scored. In a worktree at the head, the commits are removed
