"""The secrets capability: values that agents get in their environment, and that nothing shows again.

A **secret** is a name and a value. Its name is an environment variable's (``EnvName``). It belongs to the home, for
every campaign, or to one campaign, whose secret wins over the home's of the same name: a GitHub repository's secret
wins over its organization's. Config names a secret, never its value: ``{ secret = "NAME" }`` in
``[plugins.harness.<name>] env`` (``piloop.plugins.harness.contract.SecretRef``), and each variable of a
``[plugins.mcp_server.<name>]`` server, which is the name of a secret. An agent's job names the secrets that it needs
(``AgentJob.secrets``), and its worker gets their values when it starts the job. No listing, event, span or job holds
a value.

Host tier: a provider stores values. ``[plugins.secrets] provider`` in ``config.toml`` selects one (``local`` by
default). Its methods are the contract, and each takes the session of the operation that calls it. The operations here
record who set a secret and when in its events (``SecretSet``), in that transaction. The API checks who writes
(``piloop.daemon.api.secret_owner``): a campaign's secret needs ``act``, the home's ``admin``. A provider
that seals values wraps ``local``: its ``put`` seals, its ``get`` opens.
