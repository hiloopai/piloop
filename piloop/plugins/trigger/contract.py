"""The triggers of the roles: the conditions that make the daemon request an agent (https://piloop.autoresearch.inc/concepts/roles#triggers).

A trigger is a provider of ``TRIGGERS``: its fields are its parameters, from ``[plugins.trigger.<name>]``. A role names
its triggers in ``[plugins.role.<name>] triggers``. On each
**pass** over the campaigns, for each campaign and each sweeping role without a pending request, the scheduler calls
``Trigger.fire`` of each trigger of the role, in the order of the list. Once a stopped campaign's last runs are judged,
it calls only the triggers with ``ON_STOP``, and while the campaign runs, only the others. A package adds a trigger with
an entry point in the group of ``TRIGGERS``.

The daemon makes a pass when an event of a campaign's state arrives, or of a kind that a trigger reads
(``WAKES_ON``), and when the time comes that a trigger asked for (``due_in``). It does not make one on a timer.
