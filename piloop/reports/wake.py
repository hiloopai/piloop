"""Wake overviews: the most important memory, in a fixed reading budget, at the start of a session.

A session reads a short overview first and queries for more only when it needs it (the idea of OptMem's
``memo wake``). Two readers use it. A brief shows the current lessons of the repo (the ``lessons`` section). The
orchestrator runs ``piloop wake`` (``orchestrator_overview``): the latest lines of its campaign's journal, the open
inbox, the head of the campaign and the current lessons. A budget is in tokens, counted as
``CHARS_PER_TOKEN`` characters each. It covers every line printed: the headings, and the last line of a list that
counts what did not fit and says how to read it.
