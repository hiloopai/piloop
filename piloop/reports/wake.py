"""Wake overviews: the most important memory, in a fixed reading budget, at the start of a session.

A session reads a short overview first and queries for more only when it needs it (the idea of OptMem's
``memo wake``). Two overviews use it. A worker's or research sweep's brief opens with the current lessons of the
repo (``lessons_overview``). The orchestrator runs ``piloop wake`` (``orchestrator_overview``): its latest journal
lines, the open inbox, the head of each active project and the current lessons. A budget is in tokens, counted as
``CHARS_PER_TOKEN`` characters each. Lines that do not fit are counted in a last line that says how to read them.
