"""The public read side: the event feed after a cursor, and snapshots that carry the cursor they were read at.

A client reads a snapshot (``status_view``, ``inbox_view``) inside ``piloop.db.feed.snapshot``, which also returns the
id of the newest event in the same read transaction. It then reads the events after that cursor (``read``), so it
joins the two without a gap. Delivery is at least once: a client checkpoints
``next`` after it has handled a batch, resumes from its checkpoint after a disconnect, and ignores an event id it has
already handled. Each client keeps its own cursor; piloop keeps no subscriber state.

Every stored event is shown in one envelope (``Envelope``, version ``PROTOCOL``), whatever its kind, without
rewriting the row. A kind that this piloop does not know (a plugin's, or an agent's own insert) passes through with its
payload as opaque JSON. A field that does not read as its type, in a row that an older piloop let through, is null,
and ``invalid`` holds its stored text: one bad row never stops a reader.

These functions read the database and nothing else. The API serves what they return (``piloop.api.views``).
