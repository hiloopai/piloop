"""The daemon's loop: it sleeps until the feed moves or a deadline comes, then runs the consumers that it wakes.

A **consumer** is one job of the daemon, such as pushing comments or the pass over the campaigns. It names the event models
that wake it (``wakes_on``). Its ``run`` reads the tables, not the events, so an event says only "look again": running
it twice costs one more read (level-triggered, as Kubernetes controllers are). It returns when it must run again for
time alone, a **due** that it computes from the rows each time, so a restart loses none. Nothing else is periodic.

Each **turn** reads the events after the loop's cursor, runs each consumer that one of them routes to or whose due came,
then moves the cursor. A turn runs its consumers by their ``Phase``, and in the order that they were given within one. Then the loop waits on the database (``Database.wait_until``):
for a commit of this process, an event of another (the doorbell), a ``wake``, or the earliest due. The cursor lives in
memory: a daemon that starts runs every consumer once, which covers what it missed.
