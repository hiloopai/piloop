"""The daemon loop: check each role's triggers for each project, launch requested workers and reap stale state.

A tick has two phases. First, the triggers (https://piloop.autoresearch.inc/concepts/roles) insert ``workers`` rows in state ``requested``. Then the
requested rows launch in id order, as far as the role's ``max_concurrent`` allows. Anyone can insert a requested row
by hand, for example the CLI or an agent. Such a row launches in the same second phase.

Before both phases, the tick sends new comments to the running workers. For each running worker, it collects the
``note``, ``finding`` and ``decision`` comments on its run or its idea that were written since the run started. It
sends them through the worker's runtime in one prompt, one ``[piloop]`` line each (``steer_line``). An event on the
worker, ``comment.delivered`` or ``comment.undelivered``, records each delivery. A daemon restart does not send a
comment again. A worker that is still ``starting`` gets the comments on the next tick. A failed delivery is not
retried.

        The target is one idea per worker slot plus ``buffer``. So ideas exist before slots free up, and a free slot
        does not wait a whole sweep for an idea. The ideas that sweeps in flight can insert already count as backlog.
        Nothing is requested while every research slot is busy. Runnable ideas count. Ideas blocked only by
        prerequisites in flight (``waiting``) also count, because they run when those finish. An idea blocked by a
        prerequisite that is not running does not count. Below the target, a sweep fires for one of these reasons:

        - The project has no sweep yet, so there is nothing to wait for.
        - The last batch was killed. Lost prompts, timeouts or a daemon stop say nothing about the backlog, so the
          batch is retried once. This applies to a streak of killed rows no longer than one batch
          (``max_concurrent``). A second killed batch is a systemic fault and counts as a normal last sweep.
        - New results: runs finished since the role's latest row started, which that sweep could not read. A sweep
          with nothing new to read reads the same history and proposes nothing. So each consecutive sweep that
          defined no idea doubles the number of finished runs the next sweep waits for (``_empty_sweeps``). A sweep
          that defines an idea resets this. The wait is never longer than what can still come: with no run in flight,
          the finished runs are all there is.
        - The backlog is low. Research keeps sweeping while the backlog is short, not only when results come in or a
          slot is idle. A sweep that defined an idea is followed at once. After empty sweeps, research rests
          2**n − 1 times as long as its latest ended sweep took. n is the number of consecutive ended sweeps, killed
          ones included, that defined no idea. An empty queue never deadlocks, and research that keeps finding nothing
          uses at most 1/2**n of the wall-clock time.
