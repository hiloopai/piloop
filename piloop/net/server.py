"""The server of ``piloop serve``: FastAPI on uvicorn, in threads of the daemon, on the Unix socket and the network.

Every route checks its caller with a dependency: core verifies a piloop token, a call on the Unix socket without one is
the home's owner, and the network identifies any other caller (401 when nobody knows it). The caller's access must
grant the route's (403). A handler runs in the thread pool of Starlette, 40 threads; a long-poll awaits its
next call outside it, so many long-polls never starve a heartbeat.
