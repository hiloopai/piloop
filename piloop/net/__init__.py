"""The server of ``piloop serve``: the routes that clients and workers call, and who may call each one.

The network capability (``piloop.plugins.network.contract``) says how other machines reach the server and who a caller
is. What a caller may do is core's: the access of its credential (``piloop.api.contract.Access``) must grant the
route's. The server is FastAPI on uvicorn (``piloop.net.server``). It serves the API (the FastAPI routes of
``piloop.daemon.api``) and the routes that the executor contributes (``executor_router``). Data never goes through it:
workers read and write the artifact store's remote directly, and the routes pass only hashes.
