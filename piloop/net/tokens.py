"""Bearer tokens of ``piloop serve`` and ``piloop cas serve``: ``piloop token create|list|revoke``.

A secret is ``plt_`` and 32 random bytes. It is shown once, when it is made: the ``tokens`` table keeps its SHA-256
only. A token's name is the caller's name, and its access says which routes it may call. Core verifies a token on
every network, before the network identifies a caller that sends none (``piloop.net.server.authorized``).

The daemon also mints a token for each agent that it launches (``mint_agent``), which its worker hands it at its start
as ``PILOOP_AGENT_TOKEN``, as a Kubernetes pod gets its projected service-account token. The agent acts only as itself
with it, and only while its session is live.
