"""The control operations: the changes that the orchestrator or a human asks of a campaign, besides the daemon's own.

Each one is a typed function. It validates its input, makes the change and writes its event in the caller's session,
and the caller commits once. ``Refused`` says why an operation changed nothing. The CLI is a thin wrapper over these
functions, and any other client (an API, a remote controller) calls the same ones, so nothing here assumes the caller
is on the daemon's machine.

A change to a column that the change log covers (``piloop.db.triggers.changelog``) gets its event from the trigger,
signed by the connection's actor, so an operation writes no second event for it. A reason that no column holds goes
into a ``note`` on the row. An operation emits the events of the changes that no trigger logs.
