"""The core operations that an executor calls on what its jobs do (``Results``): they change the campaign's rows.

Each checks the domain only: a job's row closes once (``Settled``). Each holds the write lock from its check to the
commit, in a write transaction of its own, so two calls for one job never both pass the check. Fencing a result that comes late, or twice, is
the executor's (``piloop.plugins.executor.contract``). An agent's end is a ``JobEnded`` event on its row: what waits for
the agent reads it there (``Launcher.launch``), whichever process applied it.
