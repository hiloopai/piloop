"""Experimental: the scout mode of the research role. It files outside techniques as seeds for the measured losses.

A scout sweep is a research row with a ``SCOUT_EVENT``. The ``scout`` trigger requests one every
``[roles.research.scout] interval``, and ``piloop launch <project> research --scout`` requests one by hand. It runs
``prompts/research_scout.md`` and signs ``scout#<worker id>``. So its seeds have their own ``scout`` row in the
keeps-by-source count (``piloop.campaign.ideas.yields``), next to research's own ideas. It shares everything else
with the research role: the config table, the rotation, ``max_concurrent`` and the MCP servers. The ``low_water`` and
``seed`` triggers do not count a scout sweep and do not wait for it.

The scout's memory is the database. The technique library is the ``techniques`` table. The watch list is computed,
not stored: the X handles and GitHub repos linked from scout seeds that research developed or that kept. A source
stays on the list until ``WATCH_RUNS`` scout sweeps have started since one of its seeds last paid off. A source with
a keep stays.
