"""Raw SQL access for agents: any statement except a schema change.

The same rules apply to every client (``piloop sql``, the watchdog, any agent). SQLite's authorizer denies DDL,
ATTACH, transactions, writes to ``alembic_version``, ``session_actor``, ``tokens`` and ``secrets``, and all PRAGMAs
except the read-only ones that describe the schema. ``secrets.value`` reads as NULL. The connection is in autocommit
mode, because a forgotten BEGIN would lock the database. Everything else is allowed, DELETE included. The schema
enforces the rules on the data.

Anyone can read the full-text indexes (``ideas_fts``, ``comments_fts``, ``documents_fts``) with ``MATCH``,
``bm25()`` and ``snippet()``, but only their sync triggers write them. The authorizer sees the name of the trigger behind each
statement of a trigger body and lets those statements through. So an agent's own ``INSERT INTO ideas_fts`` (or a
``'rebuild'``) is denied, while an insert into ``ideas`` still indexes the row. The authorizer cannot tell the shadow
tables that FTS5 writes for itself (``ideas_fts_data`` and others) from a statement of an agent. SQLite's own guard
protects them instead: ``SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE`` makes shadow tables read-only for normal SQL, while FTS5 still
writes them. To repair a damaged index, run ``INSERT INTO ideas_fts (ideas_fts) VALUES ('rebuild')`` from a
connection without these limits.

Every connection, here and in the daemon's engine, has an actor. ``install_actor`` creates the TEMP objects of
the TEMP triggers of core and every plugin (``declared``) before the authorizer is turned on, because after that ``SQLITE_CREATE_TEMP_TRIGGER``
is denied. From then on, every UPDATE sets ``updated_by``, and the tracked changes, deletes and comments go into
``events``. The authorizer lets only those trigger bodies insert into ``events``, so every event has the shape of its
model (``piloop.db.models.EventModel``).

Rows of the orchestrator's ``journal`` and of ``lessons`` never change: an agent's UPDATE of them is denied, and so is
a DELETE of the journal. ``events`` is append-only: an UPDATE or a DELETE of it is denied, and TEMP triggers refuse an
insert that does not take the next id. A trigger refuses an ``INSERT OR REPLACE`` of a row
(``piloop.db.triggers.immutable``). An UPDATE of a column that only the daemon writes (``DAEMON_COLUMNS``) is denied too.
Every connection also has the
SQL function ``blake3(text)`` (``install_functions``).
