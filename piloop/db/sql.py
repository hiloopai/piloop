"""Raw SQL access for agents: any statement except a schema change.

The same rules apply to every client (``piloop sql``, the watchdog, any agent). SQLite's authorizer denies DDL,
ATTACH, transactions, writes to ``alembic_version`` and ``session_actor``, and all PRAGMAs except the read-only ones
that describe the schema. The connection is in autocommit mode, because a forgotten BEGIN would lock the database.
Everything else is allowed, DELETE included. The schema enforces the rules on the data.

Anyone can read the indexes (``piloop.db.indexes``: ``ideas_fts``, ``comments_fts``, ``documents_fts``) with
``MATCH``, ``bm25()`` and ``snippet()``, but only their sync triggers write them. The authorizer sees the name of the trigger behind each
statement of a trigger body and lets those statements through. So an agent's own ``INSERT INTO ideas_fts`` (or a
``'rebuild'``) is denied, while an insert into ``ideas`` still indexes the row. The authorizer cannot tell the shadow
tables that FTS5 writes for itself (``ideas_fts_data`` and others) from a statement of an agent. SQLite's own guard
protects them instead: ``SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE`` makes shadow tables read-only for normal SQL, while FTS5 still
writes them. To repair a damaged index, run ``INSERT INTO ideas_fts (ideas_fts) VALUES ('rebuild')`` from a
connection without these limits.

Every connection, here and in the daemon's engine, has an actor. ``install_actor`` creates the TEMP objects of
``piloop/db/actor_triggers.sql`` before the authorizer is turned on, because after that ``SQLITE_CREATE_TEMP_TRIGGER``
is denied. From then on, every UPDATE sets ``updated_by``, and the tracked changes, deletes and comments go into
``events``. The authorizer does not protect ``events``, so the INSERTs of the trigger bodies pass.

The orchestrator's ``journal`` is append-only: an agent's UPDATE or DELETE of it is denied. Every connection also has
the SQL function ``blake3(text)`` (``install_functions``).

the file is in WAL mode, the pragma does nothing. ``synchronous=NORMAL`` is the setting that SQLite recommends for
WAL. A commit survives a process crash, and only a power loss can lose the last transactions. That is acceptable for
a coordination database whose state can be rebuilt from git, and it saves the fsync on each commit that FULL adds to
every insert of an agent. ``temp_store=MEMORY`` keeps the sorts for the ``ORDER BY`` of the status and the tick out
of temporary files. ``cache_size`` stays at SQLite's default: the tables that a tick reads fit in it, and each pooled
