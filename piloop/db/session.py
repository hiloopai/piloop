"""Engine, sessions and migrations for the database.

Migrations are append-only. Every schema change is a new revision
(``uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "..."``), never an edit of an existing one. Only ``migrate`` changes the
schema, and only ``piloop serve`` (when it starts) and ``piloop migrate`` (which ``piloop upgrade`` runs) call it. Every
other command refuses a database at another revision (``schema_mismatch``) and changes nothing.

Core and each plugin with tables (``piloop.db.schema``) have their own chain of revisions and their own version
table, Alembic's recipe for several environments in one database: core's is ``alembic_version``, a plugin's
``alembic_version_<name>`` (``memory/local``: ``alembic_version_memory__local``). ``migrate`` runs core's chain first,
then each installed plugin's, in one transaction. A plugin that is not installed keeps its tables and its version
table, and nothing reads them.

Revision ids are bare numbers, so a branch's ``0006`` and ``main``'s share one. So each migration also records, in
``migrations``, a fingerprint of the chain's revision file names up to the one it stamps (``fingerprints``), and
``unmigratable`` refuses a database whose stamp or fingerprint is not in this build's history (``foreign``). 0 marks a
database that a build before fingerprints migrated: only its stamp is checked.
