"""The events feed after a cursor: the events of some topics, oldest first, and the cursor to read after next.

The event id is the cursor. SQLite has one writer at a time and allocates an id inside the writing transaction, so
the events at or below the newest id that a reader sees are all committed: a later commit never takes a smaller id.
Every piloop connection, ``piloop sql`` included, keeps it so: events are append-only, and a new event takes the next
id (``piloop.db.triggers.immutable``). Otherwise a reader whose cursor had passed a deleted, moved or explicit id would
miss the event that takes it.
