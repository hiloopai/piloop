"""Today's triggers in the names of an older schema, for the migrations that run before a renaming of it.

The migrations create the persistent triggers that the package renders today (``recreate``). Revision 0016 renamed
``projects`` to ``campaigns``, with its ``_id`` columns, and revision 0018 renamed ``workers`` to ``agent_sessions``
and the worker role to the implementer. Revision 0028 generated ``events.kind`` from the payload, so an event trigger
before it inserts the kind itself. A migration before such a change runs on a schema that still has the old form, so
``rendered`` gives a trigger its old name, its old identifiers and its old text there. Only identifiers, the role names
that a trigger lists and the event insert change: any other string literal keeps its text. Revision 0040 took the
built-in roles out of the role trigger, so a migration before it gets them back. Revision 0059 added
``comments.in_reply_to`` to the comment events, so a schema without the column gets the event without it. Revision 0065
moved the roles of a stored config to ``plugins.role``, so the role trigger before it reads ``roles``.
