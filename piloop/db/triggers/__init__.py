"""piloop's own triggers: what the migrations install (``PERSISTENT``) and what every connection installs (``TEMP``).

The change log must be TEMP: only a trigger of the connection can read the connection's actor
(``temp.session_actor``), and an event without an actor is of no use. ``updated_at`` and ``comment.escalation`` need
nothing from the connection, so they are persistent. ``updated_by`` and every event of the change log are TEMP and
belong to the connection. Core and each plugin declare the triggers on their tables (``piloop.db.schema.Schema``), and
each of piloop's schemas takes its share of these (``on``). ``piloop.db.sql.install_actor`` creates every TEMP one at
connect time (``temp_sql``). The migrations run the DDL of the persistent ones that Python renders.

To add a trigger, add one call to one tuple: ``changed('ideas', 'plan')`` in
``changelog.CHANGES`` for a decision, ``tombstone(...)`` in ``TOMBSTONES`` for a delete, a table in
``provenance.TRACKED_TABLES`` for both stamps, or a table in ``fts.FTS_COLUMNS`` for an index and its sync triggers.
A new persistent trigger also needs a migration that calls ``recreate(op, table)``. SQLite drops the triggers of a
table when Alembic's batch mode rebuilds it, so a batch migration also ends with ``recreate(op, table)``.
