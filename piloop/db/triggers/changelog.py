Every trigger here inserts one ``events`` row through ``event_insert``, with the payload of its event model: the
trigger renders its JSON from the model (``payload``), so the SQL and the model cannot drift. The event kind is
``<table singular>.<column>`` for a change, ``<singular>.deleted`` for a tombstone and ``comment.<kind>`` for a
comment. ``target_kind`` is the table's singular, which is also a ``TargetKind`` value. Payloads never have a large
