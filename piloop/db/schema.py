"""Which tables are core's and which are a plugin's.

A plugin declares its own tables in a ``Schema`` (``SCHEMAS``), and every other table is core's. A plugin's tables reference its own tables, or a core table's ``id``, which core never renames or drops. Core's tables
reference only core's. So an uninstalled plugin leaves tables that nothing else needs.

Inspiration: Django's apps, each with its own models and migrations.
