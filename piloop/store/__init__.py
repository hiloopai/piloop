"""The artifact store: a content-addressed store of blobs and the manifests that name them.

Generic: it knows files and bytes, nothing of projects, ideas or workspaces (``piloop.campaign.archive`` does). A blob
is addressed by the BLAKE3 hash of its whole content and kept zstd-compressed under ``blake3/<hash>/bytes.zst``, where
``<hash>`` is the 32-byte digest in lowercase unpadded base32: covalence's ``KvCas`` layout (``blake3/<digest>/bytes``)
with the compression in the name. A manifest is a blob too: a tree of paths, each with its blob, size and mode.

The contract callers use is ``Store``'s: ``put``/``put_path``, ``open``/``get``/``get_path``, ``has``/``missing``,
``hashes``, ``delete``, ``put_manifest``/``manifest``, and ``check``, ``usage`` and ``evict`` for upkeep. It never hands out a key or a path, so a backend that keeps many small
blobs in one pack file (a hash → pack, offset, length index) fits behind it without changing a caller. Reads and
writes stream in ``CHUNK``-sized pieces: a blob of any size is never held in memory.

The store's own directory always holds what is local; a ``Remote`` (``piloop.store.s3``) mirrors it. Every blob put
while a remote is set is uploaded and marked ``blake3/<hash>/remote``; ``evict`` uploads what is still unmarked, then
drops the local bytes of marked blobs by age and by the store's local size. Evicting at age 0 makes the directory a
staging area: a blob's bytes are dropped as soon as they are uploaded, and a read fetches them back.

Append-only in practice: ``delete`` exists for the contract, nothing calls it, and there is no garbage collection.

Retirement: this package (this module, ``tree`` and ``s3``) is deleted once piloop can depend on covalence
(github.com/hiloopai/covalence) for the same contract: a local-disk backend, streaming (multipart) reads and writes,
list and delete, and its S3 store, all reachable from Python. ``Store``'s methods map onto its CAS trait (``has``,
``missing``, ``put``, ranged ``get``), and its ``KvCas`` keeps a block under ``blake3/<digest>/bytes`` with the same
digest spelling.
